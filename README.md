## Please see below some of our findings and suggestions based on Kickstarter data

As illustrated in the chart below, we have found that while there are only a total of 604 Kickstarter campaigns for plays in Great Britain, the "theater" category is the most successful

The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. However, January, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched. This can be determined by examining the points along the trend lines of the chart. As you hover over each point with your mouse pointer, a tooltip appears with the corresponding information.
